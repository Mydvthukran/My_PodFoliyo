                        I am currently a second-year student at SIET Panchkula, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 
                        My academic focus is enriched by a minor in **Cyber Security**, reflecting my strong interest in building and securing robust digital systems.

                    <p>
                        My journey is centered around **Learning every day something new **â€”specifically building clean, modern, and high-performance user interfaces. 
                        I enjoy transforming complex ideas into intuitive web applications using React and modern CSS techniques.

                    <p>
                        I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges. Let's build something great!
